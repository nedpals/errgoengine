# SyntaxError
This error occurs when there is a syntax error in the code, and the open parenthesis `(` is not closed properly.
```
print("Hello, world!"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

```
## Steps to fix
### Close the open parenthesis
Ensure that the open parenthesis (`(`) is closed properly.
```diff
- print("Hello, world!"
+ print("Hello, world!")

```
