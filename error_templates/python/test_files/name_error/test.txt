# NameError
This error occurs when trying to use a variable (`test`) or name that has not been defined in the current scope.
```
print(test)
      ^^^^

```
## Steps to fix
### Define the variable before using it
Make sure to define the variable `test` before using it.
```diff
- print(test)
+ test = "Hello!"
+ print(test)

```
