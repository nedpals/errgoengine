# PublicClassFilenameMismatchError
This error occurs because the name of the Java file does not match the name of the public class within it.
```
public class Right {
             ^^^^^
    public static void main(String[] args) {

```
## Steps to fix
### 1. Rename your file
Rename the file to "Right.java" to match the class.

### 2. Rename the public class
The filename should match the name of the public class in the file. To resolve this, change the class name to match the filename.
```diff
- public class Right {
+ public class Wrong {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

```
