# PublicClassFilenameMismatchError
This error occurs because the name of the Java file does not match the name of the public class within it.

## Steps to fix
1. **File and Class Name Mismatch**: In Java, the filename should match the name of the public class in the file.

```diff
- public class Right {
+ public class Wrong {
```

The error is due to the mismatch between the filename (`Wrong.java`) and the class name (`Right`). To resolve this, change the class name to match the filename:

```java
public class Wrong {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
```

This modification renames the class to match the file name, resolving the error.
