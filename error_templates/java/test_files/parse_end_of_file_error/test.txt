# ParseEndOfFileError
This error indicates that the compiler reached the end of the file unexpectedly while it was expecting something more in the code.

## Explanation local to the file
The error occurred due to an incomplete block of code in the `EOF.java` file. The compiler was expecting more code or the completion of a block but encountered the end of the file prematurely.

## Steps to fix
1. Ensure that all opening braces `{` have their corresponding closing braces `}` to complete the code blocks.

```diff
   public class EOF {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           System.out.println("This is a sample program.");
+      }
   }
```

This fix completes the `main` method by adding the closing curly brace `}`.

2. If the error persists, check the entire file for missing or misplaced braces, ensuring they are correctly matched and closed. Double-check that each opening brace has a corresponding closing brace to resolve this issue.
