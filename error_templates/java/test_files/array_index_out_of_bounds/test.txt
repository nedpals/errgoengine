# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
This error occurs because the program is attempting to access an element in an array at an index that does not exist.

## Steps to fix
1. **Understanding the issue:** The error is due to the attempt to access the element at index 5 in an array that has a length of 4. Array indices start from 0, so in an array of length 4, the valid indices are from 0 to 3.

```diff
- System.out.println(nums[5]);
+ // Accessing an index beyond the array length causes the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
```

## Steps to fix (Alternative)
1. **Avoid accessing out-of-bounds index:** To fix this, ensure that the index used to access the array elements is within the bounds of the array (0 to array length - 1).

```diff
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int nums[] = {1,2,3,4};
-   System.out.println(nums[5]);
+   // Ensure the index is within the array bounds.
  }
```

Remember, in Java arrays, indices start from 0, and the last index is always length - 1. Accessing an index beyond the array's length leads to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
