# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
This error occurs because the code is trying to access index 5 that is beyond the bounds of the array which only has 4 items.
```
        int nums[] = {1,2,3,4};
        System.out.println(nums[5]);
                                ^
    }
}
```
## Steps to fix
### Accessing Array Index Within Bounds
The error is caused by trying to access an index that does not exist within the array. Instead of accessing index 5, which is beyond the array's length, change it to a valid index within the array bounds, for example, `nums[2]`.
```diff
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int nums[] = {1,2,3,4};
-         System.out.println(nums[5]);
+         System.out.println(nums[2]);
    }
}
```
This adjustment ensures that you're accessing an index that exists within the array bounds, preventing the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
