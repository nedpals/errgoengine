# UninitializedVariableError
This error occurs when you try to use a variable that has not been initialized with a value.
```
        // Variable 'number' might not have been initialized
        System.out.println(number);
                           ^^^^^^
    }
}
```
## Steps to fix
### 1. Initialize the variable
To resolve the uninitialized variable error, you need to initialize the `number` variable with a value.
```diff
public class UninitializedVariable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
-         int number;
+         int number = 0;

        // Variable 'number' might not have been initialized
```
This ensures that the variable has a valid initial value before it's used.

### 2. Assign a value before using
Alternatively, you can assign a value to the variable before using it.
```diff
public class UninitializedVariable {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
-         int number;
+         int number;
+         number = 0; // or any other valid value

        // Variable 'number' might not have been initialized
```
This way, the variable is initialized with a value before it's used in the statement.
