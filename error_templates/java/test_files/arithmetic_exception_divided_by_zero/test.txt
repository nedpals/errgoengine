# ArithmeticException
This error is raised when you try to perform arithmetic operations that are not mathematically possible, such as division by zero.
```
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double out = 3 / 0;
                         ^
        System.out.println(out);
    }
}
```
## Steps to fix
### Avoid dividing by zero.
To fix the 'ArithmeticException: / by zero', you need to ensure you are not dividing by zero, which is mathematically undefined.
```diff
public class Arith {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
-         double out = 3 / 0;
+         double out = 3 / 1;
        System.out.println(out);
    }
```
This adjustment replaces the division by zero with a value that is not zero, ensuring the operation is valid. Division by zero is mathematically undefined, causing an 'ArithmeticException'. By changing the denominator to a non-zero value, you prevent the error.
