# AlreadyDefinedError
This error occurs when you try to declare a variable with a name that is already in use within the same scope.
```
        // Attempting to redeclare the variable 'x'
        int x = 10;
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
        System.out.println(x);
    }
```
## Steps to fix
### 1. Remove redeclaration
To resolve the already defined error, remove the attempt to redeclare the variable 'x'.
```diff
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 5;
        // Attempting to redeclare the variable 'x'
-         int x = 10;
        System.out.println(x);
    }
```
Since 'x' is already declared earlier in the method, you don't need to declare it again.

### 2. Assign a new value
If you intended to change the value of 'x', you can simply assign a new value to the existing variable.
```diff
        int x = 5;
        // Attempting to redeclare the variable 'x'
-         int x = 10;
+         x = 10;
        System.out.println(x);
    }
```
This way, you update the value of 'x' without redeclaring it.
