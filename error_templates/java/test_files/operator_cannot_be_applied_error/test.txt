# OperatorCannotBeAppliedError
This error occurs when you try to apply a binary operator to incompatible operand types, such as trying to use the '<' operator between a String and an int.
```
        // Operator '<' cannot be applied to String and int
        if (text < number) {}
                 ^
    }
}
```
## Steps to fix
### 1. Use String's compareTo method
Since you are comparing a String and an int, you need to use the `compareTo` method to compare their values.
```diff

        // Operator '<' cannot be applied to String and int
-         if (text < number) {}
+         if (text.compareTo(String.valueOf(number)) < number) {}
    }
}
```
The `compareTo` method returns a negative integer if the calling string is lexicographically less than the argument string.

### 2. Convert int to String for direct comparison
If you want to compare them directly, convert the int to String using `String.valueOf()`.
```diff

        // Operator '<' cannot be applied to String and int
-         if (text < number) {}
+         if (text.equals(String.valueOf(number))) {}
    }
}
```
This ensures both operands are of the same type for comparison.
