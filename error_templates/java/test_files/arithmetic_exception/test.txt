# ArithmeticException
This error occurs when you try to divide by zero, which is not allowed in mathematics.

## Steps to fix
1. To fix this issue, you should avoid dividing by zero. In this case, you can change the division operation to something meaningful.

```diff
- double out = 3 / 0;
+ double out = 3 / 1; // Change the division to something valid
```

By changing the division from 3 / 0 to 3 / 1, you will avoid the ArithmeticException, and your code will run without errors.
