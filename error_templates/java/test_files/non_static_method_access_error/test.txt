# NonStaticMethodAccessError
This error occurs when trying to access a non-static method from a static context. In Java, a non-static method belongs to an instance of the class and needs an object to be called upon.

```
        // Attempt to call the non-static method without creating an object
        printMessage(); // This will result in an error
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
    }
}

```
## Steps to fix
1. **Create an instance of the class to access the non-static method**
```java
Main obj = new Main();
obj.printMessage(); // This will properly call the non-static method
```

The issue arises because the `printMessage()` method is non-static, meaning it belongs to an instance of the class. To use this method within the `main` method, you must create an object of the `Main` class and then call the `printMessage()` method using that object.

This correction instantiates an object (`obj`) of the `Main` class and then calls the `printMessage()` method using this object, resolving the error.
